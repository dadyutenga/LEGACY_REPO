<h4 align="center"> Track User's Smartphone/Pc Ip And Gps Location. </h4>

The tool hosts a fake website which uses an iframe to display a legit website and, if the target allows it, it will fetch the Gps location `(latitude and longitude)` of the target along with `IP Address` and `Device Information`.

<h4 align="center"> This tool is a Proof of Concept and is for Educational Purposes Only. </h4> 

Using this tool, you can find out what information a malicious website can gather about you and your devices and why you shouldn't click on random links or grant permissions like Location to them.

---
### On link click

```diff
+ it wil automatically fetch ip address and device information
! if location permission allowed, it will fetch exact location of target.
```

### Limitation

```diff

- It will not work on laptops or phones that have broken GPS, 
# browsers that block javascript,
# or if the user is mocking the GPS location. 

- Safari - auto block location permission
- Brave - auto block location permission
- Firefox - after a recent update this browser became very weird it allows location permission but it's not accurate at all.

+ Best work with Chrome browser and location accuracy will be more accurate if you use this on a smartphone.

```

### IP location vs GPS location

```diff
- Geographic location based on IP address is NOT accurate,
# Does not provide the location of the target. 
# Instead, it provides the approximate location of the ISP (Internet service provider)
```
```diff
+ GPS fetch almost exact location because it uses longitude and latitude coordinates.
@@ Once location permission is granted @@
# accurate location information is recieved to within 20 to 30 meters of the user's location.
# (it's almost exact location)
```
